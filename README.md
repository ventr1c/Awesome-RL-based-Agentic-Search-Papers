# Awesome RL-based Agentic Search Papers
This repository summarizes recent research on reinforcement‑learning (RL)‑based agentic search systems. These systems treat information‑seeking as a decision process: when a large language model (LLM) faces a complex question, it can plan and act by issuing search queries, revising those queries, and integrating evidence into its reasoning. RL techniques allow these agents to learn when to search, how intensively to search and how to integrate retrieved evidence into reasoning.
